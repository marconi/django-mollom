Django Mollom have one dependency, the PyMollom module.

First you need to install PyMollom:

  git clone https://github.com/itkovian/PyMollom

As of the moment, PyMollom doesn't come with a setup file so you have to
manually copy it inside your python installation's site-packages folder.

PyMollom requires a configuration file (.conf) for your mollom public/private
keys and other stuff. Here's an example:

  [general]
  server = http://xmlrpc.mollom.com
  base_url = <base url goes here>

  [authentication]
  public key = <public key goes here>
  private key = <private key goes here>

  [caching]
  max serverlist days  = 3
  max serverlist hours = 3

Save the file as mollom.conf. Now for django-mollom to find this file,
you need to set the MOLLOM_CONFIG_FILE settings in your settings file to the
absolute path of your mollom.conf file.

When all that is done, you can clone django-mollom using:

  git clone https://github.com/marconi/django-mollom

and run:

  python setup.py install

or you can just run:

  easy_install django-mollom
